# Fiery Ladies AI package

Some may know me from being active years ago in the Stronghold Crusader modding scene and as a member of the UCP development team - or for my love of Fire.
Out of that love over time I created with huge help from other members of the Community (Krarilotus, Hacks√ºlze, Monsterfish and others) quite a few AIs that satisfy my need to see things burn. The **"Fiery Ladies"** mod pack was born!
Here's a quick description of the characters I added so far:

### Firelord Azula
Firelord Azula is the strongest of the AIs in this package. She has been shown off my Udwin and has participated in the very first mod tournament. Her economy is very strong and her castle well designed to easily defend the Firelord from any opponents of the Firenation. She loves to use Fire: Firethrowers (representing the Firebenders of the Firenation), Engineers with Oil, Pitch, Fire Ballistae. But she also has the rest of the Firenation army at her disposal: well armoured and armed soldiers are the backbone of her army. Woe to those who oppose Her!

### General Hi
General Hi is one of Firelord Azula's most loyal generals. She controls an important fortress located at the border of the Firenation. She is tasked to limit - or better burn down - the enemy's industry. She does so through permanent raiding. She might also eventually try to defeat the enemy completely - but usually she prefers to play with them by slowly burning everything they treasure to the ground.

### General Osoroshi
General Osoroshi is another one of Firelord Azula's most loyal generals. She controls a hidden military base near the centre of the Firenation. She commands an elite siege force. She is tasked with overcoming even the strongest enemy defences and kill any who oppose the Firelord. Her fortress is mainly used to produce the weapons and armour needed to arm the soldiers and is defended by only a few men. Still, fire itself is the strongest defence and even a few Firebenders and some pitch can hold off hundreds of attackers. She is merciless and unrelenting and without care for losses and keeps laying siege to her enemies in rather quick succession until their head is off and their blood pouring down the rump.

### Akasha, The Queen Of Pain
Akasha, The Queen of Pain is a demoness and Queen of an unknown land who has forged an unsteady alliance with the Firenation. Although her army mostly consists out of war prisoners and her torture victims, never underestimate her strength nor her enjoyment for warfare - and all the suffering of course. She doesn't care much for her people or economical matters as she spents her time finding ever-new techniques to cause pain to her playthings. She loves knive-play.

### Luna, The Moon Rider
Luna is cruel, merciless and enjoys gore. She was a former leader of bandits who got defeated and had to flee into a forest. There she heard the goddess of the forest and moon "Selemene" speak to her; grant her strength and a second chance but Luna had to swore herself to her. She eagerly agreed and soon Selemene tasked her to defend the forest against those who would harm it: the Firenation. And so Luna gathered a new band of warriors and outlaws and prepares to attack the Firenation.

### Widowmaker
Widowmaker is an assassin from the future. Through a rift in space and time (or something, Idk) she was brought to this time and place in the desert. Without her sniper "Widow's Kiss" she had to learn to "snipe" with the weapons of this timeline: the bow and crossbow. She soon became a master and taught others to always hit their shot. The men she taught gathered behind her. Those who couldn't learn the art were instead instructed in the way of the Spider - to sneak and assassinate the enemy with daggers and swords. And thus over time she became a free leader - an outlaw - in the desert. Without allegiance to anyone she and her followers attacked any city or town and gained in power.
